# Dice Game Simulator

This is a Python code snippet for simulating a dice game. It defines a function `play_game()` that users can call to play the game. 

**How to play:** The game simulates rolling two dice and outputs the result of the game based on the total number of points on the dice. If the total is 7 or 11, the player wins the game. If the total is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses the game. If the total is any other number, that number becomes the player's "point" and the player continues rolling the dice until they either roll their point again (in which case they win) or roll a 7 (in which case they lose). 

**Note:** To use the code, simply call the `play_game()` function. Enjoy the game!
